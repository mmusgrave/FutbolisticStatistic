# JSProject

MVP

My project will involve data visualization of soccer games of the course of multiple seasons. A free API will be used and data will be returned in JSON format. The data analysis will involve winning percentages for each team, winning percentages against all the teams in their division, and other sets of statistics.
- Interaction with each visual display
- Visual graphics for each individual league
- Visual graphics for each team

Technologies, Libraries, APIs

This data visualization project will use JavaScript, HTML, CSS, but it will primarily use the D3.js library. JavaScript will be used for the logic of selecting which team or league to display, and will display them using HTML and CSS. All data visualization will be done using the D3 library. All data will be received from either the football-data.org API, the sportradar soccer API, or the SportsOpenData API.

Wireframes

The wireframe is attached in the repo. The top wireframe has 2 dropdowns, none of which have been selected. The second wireframe has one of the dropdown menus selected. A third dropdown menu appears and has all the available statistics for display. They appear on the right side of the page.

Implementation Timeline

This will be the road map for your application. You have about three days for this project. Refer to your MVP and group the features into three phases. Break down each phase into several sub-tasks to keep yourself organized.

You should have a working app at the end of each phase (even if not all of your features are in yet).

Day 1:
I should set up all the necessary features for a working web app. This includes the node modules, webpack, index.html page, and installing D3.js. This first day will involve learning all about D3 and connecting the API endpoints.

Day 2:
This day will involve further learning about D3, and figuring out how to render data visuals using an API. The goal for this day is to have at least one working data visual up.

Day 3: This day will continue where day 2 left off. I will continue producing the Data visuals using the API endpoints. Also, by the end of the day the all necessary HTML features for the page will be implemented.
