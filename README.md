# JSProject

MVP

Write a one-sentence summary of the project and a list of the features that are absolutely necessary. Order these by importance and use the list to guide your development.

Technologies, Libraries, APIs

How will you architect the game? Will it use vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS or will you use a library like React? Will you use any other libraries or API's? Summarize the technical challenges you anticipate and how you plan to solve them.

Wireframes

This will be a lot less involved than for your Full Stack Project, but make sure you have drawings for each view, including modals.

Backend

If your project is going to have a backend, outline the db schema and models needed.

Implementation Timeline

This will be the road map for your application. You have about three days for this project. Refer to your MVP and group the features into three phases. Break down each phase into several sub-tasks to keep yourself organized.

You should have a working app at the end of each phase (even if not all of your features are in yet).
